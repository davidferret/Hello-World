# Hello, World!

Welcome to my first program on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰ This is a simple yet iconic project that prints "Hello, World!" and introduces me by name. It's a great starting point for my coding journey and a small step toward building more complex projects in the future.

## About the Program

This program demonstrates the basics of programming by:

1. Printing "Hello, World!" to the screen.
2. Printing my name to introduce myself.

### Why "Hello, World!"?
"Hello, World!" is traditionally the first program written when learning a new programming language. It symbolizes the beginning of a new journey into coding.
