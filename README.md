# Hello, World!

Welcome to my first program on GitHub! This is a simple yet iconic project that prints "Hello, World!" and introduces me by name. It's a great starting point for my coding journey and a small step toward building more complex projects in the future.


## Program Output

When you run the program, you'll see:

```
Hello, World! My name is David Ferret!
```

## Future Goals

This project is just the start! As I grow my programming skills, I aim to:

- Explore different programming languages.
- Build more advanced projects.
- Share my learning journey here on GitHub.

## Connect with Me

I'm excited to connect with others who are passionate about coding and technology. Feel free to reach out or leave suggestions for improvement!

This program may be simple, but every big journey starts with a single step. Thanks for checking it out!
